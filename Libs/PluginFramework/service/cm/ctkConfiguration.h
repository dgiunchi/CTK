/**
 * The configuration information for a {@code ctkManagedService} or
 * {@code ctkManagedServiceFactory} object.
 *
 * The Configuration Admin service uses this interface to represent the
 * configuration information for a {@code ctkManagedService} or for a
 * service instance of a {@code ctkManagedServiceFactory}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code ctkConfiguration} object contains a configuration dictionary and
 * allows the properties to be updated via this object. Plugins wishing to
 * receive configuration dictionaries do not need to use this class - they
 * register a {@code ctkManagedService} or
 * {@code ctkManagedServiceFactory}. Only administrative plugins, and
 * plugins wishing to update their own configurations need to use this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * The properties handled in this configuration have case insensitive
 * {@code QString} objects as keys. However, case is preserved from the
 * last set key/value.
 * <p>
 * A configuration can be <i>bound </i> to a plugin location (
 * {@code ctkPlugin#getLocation()}). The purpose of binding a
 * {@code ctkConfiguration} object to a location is to make it impossible
 * for another plugin to forge a PID that would match this configuration. When a
 * configuration is bound to a specific location, and a plugin with a different
 * location registers a corresponding {@code ctkManagedService} object or
 * {@code ctkManagedServiceFactory} object, then the configuration is not
 * passed to the updated method of that object.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a configuration's location is empty, it is not yet bound to
 * a location. It will become bound to the location of the first plugin that
 * registers a {@code ctkManagedService} or
 * {@code ctkManagedServiceFactory} object with the corresponding PID.
 * <p>
 * The same {@code ctkConfiguration} object is used for configuring both a
 * Managed Service Factory and a Managed Service. When it is important to
 * differentiate between these two the term "factory configuration" is used.
